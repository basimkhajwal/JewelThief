# JewelThief
My game entry (hopefully) for Ludum Dare 35. It should become a game where you have to get to the end of each successive level to steal the jewel.
Along the way you need to dodge the security which will let you go if you are the same shape as them (hence shape shifting theme) and you can toggle
your shape as well. 

It's being written in pure HTML / CSS / Javascript with no external libaries, apart from any code in js/engine/* which is my own code from a previous
project which was abandoned. (https://github.com/basimkhajwal/TheZamboniChronicles).
